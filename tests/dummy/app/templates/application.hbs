<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  This component wraps the
  <a href="http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/" target="selectize-demo"><prop>selectize</prop></a> control developed by Brian Reavis. This control has become very popular due to its small footprint, skinnable interface and programatic API (including a plugin API). The general principle for this Ember component is just to make Brian's control easily accessible within an ember application so his documentation --
  <a href="http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/" target="selectize-demo">found here</a> --
  is still quite relevant.
